# Backup

## TODO

* Figure out a strategy for making backups
* Buy a harddrive

## Ideas

* Encryption Key on QR code
* raspberry pi as file server

## Software

* rsync
* borg
* duplicati
* restic

## Don't forget

* when rsync'ing to USB, use `--modify-window=2`, as FAT does not store accurate timestamps
